Travelhelper is an unfininished schenghen area visa calculator

There is a restriction that visitors are not permitted to spend more than 90 days within 180 days in the territory of the Schengen Area using travel visa even using long-term (e.g. 1 year) visa.
There are different online calculators that let you input previous visits' dates and tell you how many more you have left however it's tedious to have to input them every time.
This project was supposed to store user's visits to the database so it'd be possible to add them just once and check visa availability using an endpoint that can be called from some UI.

The goal of the projects was to help me track my own visits but then I relocated to EU and didn't have motivation to continue it anymore. 
It still helped me learn more about Spring security with the help of another github user who's kindly reviewed my code and explained tons of stuff about OAuth. This was also my first experience with Kotlin.
